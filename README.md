# Snowflake_HealthCheck App
Snowflake Streamlit Project References

This post builds on the dashboard examples built using Snowsight but now utilizing new capabilities in Streamlit-in-Snowflake (SiS). In late September Snowflake announced support for SiS (here). SiS gives our customers the ability to create applications without the need for multiple languages. Snowflake customers can now use Python to create visualizations and utilize standard Snowflake security to share these apps with different roles. All content is housed within the secure walls of the Snowflake platform.

If you havenâ€™t used the previous example in Snowsight please see here.

Some key areas we have focused on with the Streamlit version vs. Snowsight:

Ease of use: there is no manual work needed to recreate the dashboard it is quite literally copy & paste and you can get started

Code Examples: Utilize our examples for visualizing data in Streamlit while also utilizing components such as a date picker to manipulate date

Portability: Easily manipulate this template to use with other tables or sources within your Snowflake account
